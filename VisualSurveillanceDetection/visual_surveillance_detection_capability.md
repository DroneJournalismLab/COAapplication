Attach description for all:


Visual observers will be stationed within voice distance of the pilot in command and will be responsible for alerting the pilot of any potential issues on the ground or in the air near and around the test site. The distance to the device would be based on line of sight. The DJI Phantoms, with their white exterior, are difficult to see at about 300 feet distance -- in altitude or lateral distance from the takeoff point. Therefore, the distance from the visual observer will be constrained by that distance. 

The Phantom being used has video transmitted back to a screen allowing for forward facing video to be seen by the pilot or visual observer.
