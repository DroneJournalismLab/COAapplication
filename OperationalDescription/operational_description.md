###Program Exectutive Summary

Briefly describe for FAA Executives overall Program objectives

__Drone Journalsm Lab answer__: 

    The Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Journalism and Mass Communications seeks to test safety and ethical procedures that could be used with UAS platforms to report news. Unmanned platforms offer journalists an opportunity to obtain an aerial perspective of large-scale events from a low altitude and at low cost, giving the public a view of matters of public importance in keeping with their First Amendment mission. However, a UAS opens new questions of how journalists could and should use an aerial platform for news. We intend to explore issues of safety, privacy and ethics as well as the practical dimensions of the platform for news reporting in controlled environments to help guide ethical, legal and policy decisions about UAS's and the First Amendment. The area encompassed by this COA is a crop research plot run by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln that we will be flying over to test different methods and techniques. 



###Operational Summary###

(Include only information not able to be provided elsewhere in the application. Example: "Operations of the Hunter UAS in Class "D" airspace at or below 3000 feet AGL. The operation will launch/recover to/from Wright AAF, transition to/from R-3005, then transition to W-157A, then return via same route." Include altitudes, times of flight, duration of flight, frequency of flight, etc... Provide any details that will explain what you intend to do during flight operations.") 

__Drone Journalism Lab answer__: 

    Operations of the DJI Phantom UAS will be at an off-airport location in class G airspace more than 5 NM from the nearest airport or heliport below 400 feet AGL within visual line-of-sight. The UAV will be less than 0.5 NM from the pilot and observer at all times. Flights will be during daylight hours. A typical flight will be to take off (these are vertical takeoff and landing vehicles), fly a grid over the section of a field immediately adjacent to the takeoff point, and return to landing. Most flights are not likely to take the vehicle more than 800 feet (0.13 NM) horizontally from the takeoff location. Multiple flights back-to-back are likely with field visits averaging once or twice a week.
