###Program Exectutive Summary

Briefly describe for FAA Executives overall Program objectives

__Drone Journalsm Lab answer__: 

    The Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Journalism and Mass Communications seeks to test the efficacy of using small off-the-shelf UAS platforms to report news. Unmanned platforms offer journalists an opportunity to obtain an aerial perspective of large-scale events from a low altitude and at low cost, giving the public a view of matters of public importance. However, a UAS opens new questions of how journalists could and should use an aerial platform for news. We intend to explore issues of safety, privacy and ethics as well as the practical dimensions of the platform for news reporting in controlled environments to help guide ethical, legal and policy decisions about UAS's and the First Amendment.


###Operational Summary###

(Include only information not able to be provided elsewhere in the application. Example: "Operations of the Hunter UAS in Class "D" airspace at or below 3000 feet AGL. The operation will launch/recover to/from Wright AAF, transition to/from R-3005, then transition to W-157A, then return via same route." Include altitudes, times of flight, duration of flight, frequency of flight, etc... Provide any details that will explain what you intend to do during flight operations.") 

__Drone Journalsm Lab answer__: 

    Operations of the DJI Phantom UAS in Class "G" airspace at or below 400 feet AGL. The operations will launch, recover and be conducted over University of Nebraska-Lincoln owned lands during daylight hours. To maintain line of sight, flights will remain below 400 feet -- normally below 200 feet -- and within 300 linear feet from the launch point. Flights, from takeoff to touchdown, will last between 5 and 15 minutes depending on battery and weather conditions. Multiple flights will occur consecutively. During flight operations, we will be assessing the feasibility of using the platform to obtain video, photo and other data from a given point designated on the property. The resulting data obtained from the UAS will be combined with qualitative and quantitative data about the flight itself and combined into a feasibility study.
