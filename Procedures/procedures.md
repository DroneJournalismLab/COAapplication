* Lost Link/Mission Procedures	     Attach Description (0)

The UAV has two radio links (Bluetooth and RC), both capable of controlling the UAV (see Communications Systems Description).  If the Bluetooth link on the UAV is lost, the UAV will revert to RC control and the pilot will takeover flight, return it to the landing zone and land it.

If the RC link is lost, the UAV is configured to execute an Return To Home procedure created by the manufacturer to prevent drift outside of the operation area. In a Return To Home scenario, the aircraft will stop, elevate or descend to 60 feet AGL, and take a direct course to the original takeoff spot as recorded by GPS. Once over the home point, it will land itself. In this case the pilot and observer will attempt to verbally warn any unsuspecting bystanders.

Communications between pilot and ATC

Due to this COA being in Class G airspace and far enough from the nearest airport to not require direct two-way radio communications with the appropriate ATC facilities, we only anticipate communicating with the ATC prior to our mission and after our mission to notify them of when we start and finish the mission. In the event of an emergency, we will make sure to have a cell phone with good signal strength and knowledge of the appropriate phone numbers to contact the ATC.

Communications between pilot and visual observers (VOs)

It is anticipated that the pilot and VOs will be within easy direct voice communication during all of our missions. Handheld radios will be part of the standard equipment and will be available in case something comes up that prevents the pilot and VOs from being within easy direct voice communication distance of each other.

* Emergency Procedures	     Attach Description (0)

Emergency Assumption of Control

If there is any concern that the UAV is not flying the programmed mission, the operator will take manual control of the UAV with RC control, return it to the landing zone if able, and land it. There may be minor problems that do not require emergency assumption of control. In these cases, the GCS communication can direct the UAV to land or manually land the UAV.

Loss of Sight

Using the GCS, execute a preprogrammed flight path to return to the landing zone. If the observer is unable to see the UAV after this, then the pilot will take manual control. The UAV will be descending at a slow rate until it is again visible or it lands.

Loss of Power/Motor

Attempt control the UAV to land in a safe area.

Verbally warn any unsuspecting bystanders.

Make sure sure observer or pilot has a cellphone in case of emergency.

Inflight Fire

The pilot will take manual control with RC and land the UAV in the the designated landing zone or if not possible, the nearest and safest landing zone.
