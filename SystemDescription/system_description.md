Attach Description Of Aircraft System:	

The aircraft is a DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter that has been augmented with a Zenmuse 3-axis camera gimbal designed to hold a GoPro Hero 3 camera and a 5.7 ghz transmitter capable of sending near-live video back to the ground station from the GoPro. The Phantom also has a DJI 2.4G Bluetooth Data Link that connects to an iPad running DJI's Ground Station Software. The Ground Station software is capable of programming waypoints and provides real-time telemetry from the aircraft, including altitude, heading and speed, both horizontal and vertical speed. The DJI Phantom 2 is one of the most popular consumer models of quadcopter in the world.

The manufacturer's specs on the base model are as follows: 
    
|Category|Value|
|--------|-----|
|Weight  |1000g|
|Hover Accuracy, vertical|0.8m|
|Hover Accuracy, horizontal|2.5m|
|Max Yaw Angular Velocity|200°/s|
|Max Tilt Angle|35°|
|Max Ascent|6m/s|
|Max Descent|2m/s|
|Max Flight Speed|15m/s(Not Recommended)|
|Diagonal Length|350mm|
|Flight Time|25mins|
|Operating Temperature|-10°C ~ 50°C|

With modifications, the weight of the aircraft is 1348g, and subsequently the flight times in indoor testing have been around 20 minutes. 

*Control Station:
   No. of stations, remote control, etc.

The ground control station is primarily a 2.4GHz ISM DJI remote controller manufactured for the DJI Phantom. The RC controller has primary control of the aircraft and is able to override the Ground Station software. The manufacturers specs list a 1000m range in open ground for the controller. 

A secondary controller for the Phantom is an Apple iPad Air (4th generation iPad) with DJI's Ground Control software installed. The iPad is connected to the Phantom through a 2.4G Bluetooth wireless connector. The Ground Control software is capable of programming and transmitting automated routes for the Phantom 2 based on GPS, and also provides real-time location, speed, heading and altitude information to the pilot in command.  
    
At any time, the pilot may override the commands from the iPad via the RC unit. The RC unit is capable of assuming control without commands from the iPad and has ultimate control of the aircraft.


*Communication Systems Description:	
    
The DJI controller is a standard hobby RC controller operating in the 2.4 GHz range that uses spread spectrum technology for interference immunity (DJI 2.4Ghz RF DESST).

The Bluetooth Data Link specs from the manufacturer are as follows: 

|Category|Value|
|--------|-----|
|RF Data Rate|1536kbps|
|Indoor/Urban Range|≤350m|
|Outdoor/RF Line-Of-Sight Range|≤2km|
|Transmit Power|≤125mW|
|Receiver Sensitivity (1%PER)|-94dBm|
|Power Consumption, the Ground end|≤2.3W|
|Power Consumption, the Air end|≤1.8W|
|Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power|≤100mW|
|Frequency Band|2.4G(2400MHz ~2483MHz)|
|Serial Data Rate|115200 bps|
|Antenna Options|SMA|
|Operating Temperature|-10°C ~+60°C|

Communications between pilot and VOs will be direct verbal. Radio communications with ATC is not anticipated as necessary, therefore, cell phones will be used when communication with the ATC is required.

*Certified TSO Components	
    
There are no TSO certified parts on the aircraft.
