###Drone Journalism Lab's Statement###

Airworthiness StatementPoint of Contact: Matt WaiteDrone Journalism Lab, College of Journalism and Mass Communications,University of Nebraska-LincolnLast Updated: February, 2014The University has developed internal procedures based on AR70-62 to effectively demonstrate and assert that the UAS being considered is airworthy. The UAS meets the applicable airworthiness standards and requirements of our University process, and is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable requirements in 14 CFR Part 91. The University assumes all risks and liabilities with the UAS and confirms there are no additional known limitations or nonstandard safety precautions other than those listed below as recommended by the manufacturer or other safety protocols:Environment:
* Do not fly in rain, fog or snow. Moisture can lead to defects of the electronics.* Avoid flying in sandy or dusty areas. Mechanical parts may deteriorate rapidly. * Very cold temperatures lead to reduced flight times. Do not fly in temperatures below 0°C. Notice that the flight time will already be reduced below 5°C. Use heated batteries if you fly below 5°C (put them on a heater with e.g. 30°C shortly before your flight).* Hot temperatures (above 35°C) will also interfere with the batteries. The voltage level is slightly increased, but will drop rapidly at the end of the flight. Always have an eye on the battery voltage and the flight time to avoid an empty battery during the flight.* While the manufacturer lists no wind limitations, users have reported instability at and above 25 mph (11.2 m/s). Do not fly with gusts exceeding 25 mph.
